            <h1>MANYAPURI TEJASWINI - 21JG1A4230</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my personal web space. I am a diligent and ambitious B.Tech student currently in my third year in the department CSE(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering for Women, Kommadi, Madhurawada. Originating from Vizag district of Andhra Pradesh, I harbor a deep-seated passion for continuous learning and a steadfast commitment to achieving excellence in both academic and professional pursuits.</p>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have maintained a current CGPA of 7.6, reflecting my dedication to scholastic endeavors. In the pursuit of practical knowledge, I have successfully completed internships at reputable organizations. Notably, I delved into the intricacies of Data Science during my tenure at "1Stop" Platform. Additionally, I honed my skills in Full Stack Web Development at "Skriptonic Consulting Pvt. Ltd" in Hyderabad. These experiences have provided valuable insights, fostering both personal and professional growth.</p>
            <p>My overarching goal is to attain independence through relentless effort and dedication. I am enthusiastic about exploring diverse technologies, continuously expanding my skill set, and embracing new challenges that come my way.</p>
